From two sets of data given, we need to get a list of products purchased by the customers. Note that the sales transaction files will have two records for the same product if a customer would have purchased a product two times in two separate transactions. So the Total Quantity field should have the sum of quantity from these transactions. And the total amount should have the total quantity multiplied by the price of the product.
